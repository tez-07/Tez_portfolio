                <strong>Name: Tez Borgohain
                    <br>Age: 27
                    <br>Status: Student || Part-time Employee

            <p id="col"> My name is Tez Borgohain, and I recently completed the Project Management Program at Humber College. During this time, I honed essential professional skills such as planning, organization, execution, and clear, impactful communication. The program provided a comprehensive understanding of core project management principles and methodologies, preparing me to effectively navigate complex tasks and challenges in any business setting. However, while I found value in mastering these structured processes, I gradually realized that my true interests lie elsewhere—in a realm that allows for more creativity and visual expression. This realization prompted me to reflect deeply on what truly inspires me and motivates me to create. Although I respect the structure and discipline that project management demands, I’ve decided to shift my career path toward something that feels more aligned with my personality and passion.
            </p>

            <p id="col">From a young age, I have been drawn to the power of visual storytelling. Graphic design, in particular, has always captivated me with its ability to convey emotions, ideas, and messages through artful composition. Over the years, what began as an admiration for great design evolved into a compelling desire to create meaningful visuals myself. My creative instincts, combined with the problem-solving abilities developed through my academic and professional background, inspired me to take a bold step toward a new beginning. Enrolling in a formal graphic design course marks the start of this exciting journey into the arts and design industry. I am enthusiastic about developing new skills, expanding my creative toolkit, and immersing myself in the world of design thinking. My goal is to merge analytical precision with artistic flair to craft engaging, functional, and visually striking solutions. Ultimately, I aspire to create designs that resonate with people, tell stories with impact, and leave a lasting impression.
